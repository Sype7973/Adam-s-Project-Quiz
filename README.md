# Adam-s-Project-Quiz


- I wanted to make a quiz that had questions around the coding topings i have learnt in my bootcamp
- I built this project to put the skills of javascript to the test by utilising localstorage and a variety of other javascript functions to create a quiz that stores information.
- I created a quiz that has helped me understand how to build javascript functions correctly.
- I learn't that javascript is extremely dynamic and that sometimes there are multiple ways to solve a problem and often over complicating things can be a big time sapper
